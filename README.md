The front-end of the website was accomplished using bootstrap only . Apart from this , for making the website responsive jQuery was used and AJAX request using jQuery was implemented to communicate on the sever-side . 

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS and quickly prototype the ideas with Sass variables and mixins , responsive grid system and powerful plugins built on jQuery.
